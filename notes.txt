the process of saving or writing state of an object to a file is called serialization.

in other words it is a process of converitng an object from java supported version to file supported version ir network supported version.
Object OutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream (new FileOutputStream("file path"));

by using FileOutputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes we can achieve Serialization.

The process of reading state of an Object from a file is Called Deserialization

By using FileInputStream and ObjectInputStream class we can achieve Deserialization.

ObjectInputStream ois = ObjectInputStream (new FileInputStream("file path"));

here transient for the variables means during deserializtion of object we can hide them as we cannot see those variables
